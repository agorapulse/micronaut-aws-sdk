=== Kinesis

> Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information.

This library provides three approaches to work with Kinesis streams:

1. High-level <<Publishing with `@KinesisClient`>>
2. High-level <<Listening with `@KinesisListener`>>
3. Middle-level <<Kinesis Service>>

==== Configuration

By default, only `aws.kinesis.application.name` and `aws.kinesis.listener.stream` are required if you decide to use `@KinesisListener`.
Otherwise you need no configuration at all but some of the configuration may be useful for you.

[source,yaml,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.application.yml
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/resources/application-docs-kinesis.yml[]
----
<1> You can specify the default stream for https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/KinesisService.html[KinesisService] and `@KinesisClient`
<2> You can define multiple configurations
<3> Each of the configuration can be access using `@Named('test') KinesisService` qualifier or you can define the configuration as `value` of `@KinesisClient('test')`
<4> Application name is required for `@KinesisListner`
<5> Optional id of the Kinesis worker (listener)
<6> Stream to listen is required for `@KinesisListener`
<7> You can define multiple listeners configurations
<8> The name of the configuration will be used as `value` of `@KinesisListener('test')`


==== Publishing with `@KinesisClient`

If you place `com.agorapulse.micronaut.aws.kinesis.annotation.KinesisClient` annotation on the interface then methods
matching predefined pattern will be automatically implemented. Every method of `KinesisClient` puts new records into
the stream.

The following example shows many of available method signatures for publishing records:

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.Publishing String Records
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/DefaultClient.java[tags=header]
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/DefaultClient.java[tags=string]
}
----
<1> `@KinesisClient` annotation makes the interface a Kinesis client
<2> You can put String into the stream with generated UUID as partition key
<3> You can user predefined partition key
<4> If the name of the argument does not contain word `parition` then `@PartitionKey` annotation must to be used
<5> You can put String into the stream with predefined partition key and a sequence number
<6> If the name of the sequence number argument does not contain word `sequence` then `@SequenceKey` annotation must to be used
<7> The type of parition key and sequence number does not matter as the value will be always converted to string

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.Publishing Byte Array Records
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/DefaultClient.java[tags=header]
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/DefaultClient.java[tags=bytes]
}
----
<1> `@KinesisClient` annotation makes the interface a Kinesis client
<2> You can put byte array into the stream, UUID as partition key will be generated
<3> If the name of the argument does not contain word `parition` then `@PartitionKey` annotation must to be used
<4> You can put several records wrapped into iterable of `PutRecordsRequestEntry`
<5> You can put several records wrapped into array of `PutRecordsRequestEntry`
<6> If the single argument is of type `PutRecordsRequestEntry` then `PutRecordsResult` object is returned from the method despite only single record has been published

.Publishing Plain Old Java Objects
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/DefaultClient.java[tags=header]
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/DefaultClient.java[tags=pogo]
}
----
<1> `@KinesisClient` annotation makes the interface a Kinesis client
<2> You can put any object into the stream, UUID as partition key will be generated, the objects will be serialized to JSON
<3> You can put array of any objects into the stream, UUID as partition key will be generated for each record, each object will be serialized to JSON
<4> You can put iterable of any objects into the stream, UUID as partition key will be generated for each record, each object will be serialized to JSON
<5> You can put any object into the stream with predefined partition key, if the name of the argument does not contain word `parition` then `@PartitionKey` annotation must to be used

[source,java,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.Publishing Events
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/DefaultClient.java[tags=header]
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/DefaultClient.java[tags=events]
}
----
<1> `@KinesisClient` annotation makes the interface a Kinesis client
<2> You can put object implementing `Event` into the stream
<3> You can put iterable of objects implementing `Event` into the stream
<4> You can put array of objects implementing `Event` into the stream
<5> Without any parameters `@KinesisClient` publishes to default stream of the default configuration but you can change it using `@Stream` annotation on the method


NOTE: The return value of the method is `PutRecordResult` or `PutRecordsResult` for putting multiple records but it can be always
omitted and replaced with `void`.

By default, `KinesisClient` publishes records into the default stream defined by `aws.kinesis.stream` property.
You can switch to different configuration by changing the `value` of the annotation such as `@KinesisClient("other")` or
by setting the `stream` property of the annotation such as `@KinesisClient(stream = "MyStream")`. You can change stream
used by particular method using `@Stream` annotation as mentioned above.

==== Listening with `@KinesisListener`

TIP: Before you start implementing your service with `@KinesisListener` you may consider implementing a Lambda function
instead.

If you place `com.agorapulse.micronaut.aws.kinesis.annotation.KinesisListener` annotation on the method in the bean
then the method will be triggered with the new records in the stream.

.Publishing Events
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/KinesisListenerTester.java[tags=all]
----
<1> `@KinesisListener` method must be declared in a bean, e.g. `@Singleton`
<2> You can listen to just plain string records
<3> You can listen to `Record` objects
<4> You can listen to both string and `Record` objects
<5> You can listen to objects implementing `Event` interface
<6> You can listen to both `Event` and `Record` objects
<7> You can listen to any object as long as it can be unmarshalled from the record payload

You can listen to different than default configuration by changing the `value` of the annotation such as `@KinesisListener("other")`.

Multiple methods in a single application can listen to the same configuration (stream). In that case, every method will be executed with the
incoming payload.

==== Kinesis Service

`KinesisService` provides middle-level API for creating, describing, and deleting streams. You can manage shards as well as read records
from particular shards.

Instance of `KinesisService` is created for the default Kinesis configuration and each stream configuration in `aws.kinesis.streams` map.
You should always use `@Named` qualifier when injecting `KinesisService` if you have more than one stream configuration present, e.g. `@Named("other") KinesisService otherService`.

Please, see https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/kinesis/KinesisService.html[KinesisService] for the full reference.

==== Testing
You can very easily mock any of the interfaces and declarative services but if you need close-to-production
Kinesis integration works well with https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] and https://localstack.cloud/[LocalStack].

You need to add following dependencies into your build file:

[source,indent=0,role="primary"]
.Gradle
----
compile group: 'org.testcontainers', name: 'localstack', version: '1.10.2'
compile group: 'org.testcontainers', name: 'spock', version: '1.10.2'
----

[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>
    <artifactId>localstack</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>
    <artifactId>spock</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

----

Then you can setup your tests like this:
