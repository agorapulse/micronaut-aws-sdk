=== Security Token Service (STS)

> The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users).

This library provides basic support for Amazon STS using <<Security Token Service>>

==== Security Token Service

`SecurityTokenService` provides only one method (with multiple variations) to create credentials
which assumes usage of a certain IAM role.

Following example shows how to create credentials for assumed role.

Please, see https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/sts/SecurityTokenService.html[SecurityTokenService] for the full reference.

==== Testing
It is recommended just to mock the `SecurityTokenService` in your tests as it only contains single abstract method.
