== Micronaut Grails

Micronaut Grails package helps using Micronaut beans in the Grails application or any other Spring application.
There are two additional features which cannot be found the official https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#springBeans[Spring support for Micronaut]:

  1. Micronaut beans' names defaults to lower-cased simple name of the class as expected by Grails
  2. Ability to reuse existing properties declared by Grails - e.g. `grails.redis.port` can be injected as `@Value('${redis.port}')`


=== Installation

[source,indent=0,role="primary",subs='verbatim,attributes']
.Gradle
----
compileOnly 'com.agorapulse:micronaut-grails:{version}'
----

TIP: If you plan to reuse same library for Micronaut and Grails, you can declare the dependency as  `compileOnly`.

=== Usage

The integration is handle by bean processor which needs to be injected into Spring application context. The easiest
thing is to create Spring configuration placed next to your Micronaut classes. The Spring configuration class will
create `MicronautBeanImporter` which will be later processed by the processor bean:

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-grails/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/grails/GrailsMicronautBeanProcessorSpec.groovy[tags=configuration]
----
<1> Define class as Spring `@Configuration`
<2> Declare method which returns bean processor `@Bean`
<3> The name of the Spring bean defaults to the _property name_ of the class, e.g. `widget`
<4> You can provide different name
<5> You can qualify using a stereotype (annotation)
<6> You can qualify using the name of the bean which will be the same in the Spring application
<7> You can combine any qualifiers possible to narrow the search to single bean which needs to be available from the Spring application context


WARNING: If more then one bean qualifies the criteria then an exception will be thrown.

Once you have your configuration class ready then you can create `META-INF/spring.factories` descriptor in resources folder
which will automatically load the configuration once the JAR is on classpath.
