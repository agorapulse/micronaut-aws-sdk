=== WebSockets for API Gateway

> In a WebSocket API, the client and the server can both send messages to each other at any time. Backend servers can easily push data to connected users and devices, avoiding the need to implement complex polling mechanisms.

This library provides components for easy handling of incoming WebSocket proxied events as well as for sending
messages back to the clients

==== Installation

[source,indent=0,role="primary",subs='verbatim,attributes']
.Gradle
----
compile 'com.agorapulse:micronaut-aws-sdk-ag-ws:{project-version}'
----

[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary",subs='verbatim,attributes']
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.agorapulse</groupId>
    <artifactId>micronaut-aws-sdk-ag-ws</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>

==== Configuration
No configuration is required but some of the configuration properties may be useful for you.

[source,yaml,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.application.yml
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk-test/src/test/resources/application-docs-websockets.yml[]
----
<1> You can specify the default connections URL for https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/MessageSender.html[MessageSender]
<2> If you are creating Java functions don't forget to specify the function's name for deployments

NOTE: https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/MessageSender.html[MessageSender] bean
is only present in the context if `aws.websocket.connectins.url` configuration property is present.Use https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/MessageSenderFactory.html[MessageSenderFactory]
If you want to create https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/MessageSender.html[MessageSender]
manually using URL which is not predefined.

==== Usage

https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/master/aws-lambda-java-events[AWS SDK Lambda Events library] does not contain the events dedicated to WebSocket API Gateway yet.
You can use https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/WebSocketConnectionRequest.html[WebSocketConnectionRequest]
as an argument to function handling connection and disconnection of the WebSocket and https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/WebSocketRequest.html[WebSocketRequest] for handling
incoming messages.

**The following examples assume that you have created function using `mn create-function` command.**

The simplest example is a echo method can be used to handle all the incoming events and reply to the incoming messages and also
publishes to SNS:

[source,groovy,indent=0,role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
include::{root-dir}/subprojects/micronaut-aws-sdk-ag-ws/src/test/groovy/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/LambdaEchoFunction.groovy[]
----
<1> Factory to create `MessageSender` if we want to reply to the message immediately
<2> Service to publish to SNS to forward the message
<3> https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/WebSocketRequest.html[WebSocketRequest] can handle any incoming event
<4> Create https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/MessageSender.html[MessageSender] for current client
<5> `connectionId` is unique identifier of the client
<6> `CONNECT` event signals new client has been connected
<7> `MESSAGE` event signals new incoming message
<8> `DISCONNECT` event signals client has been disconnected
<9> The method must always return `WebSocketResponse.OK` to signal success

----
<1> Factory to create `MessageSender` if we want to reply to the message immediately
<2> Service to publish to SNS to forward the message
<3> https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/WebSocketRequest.html[WebSocketRequest] can handle any incoming event
<4> Create https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/MessageSender.html[MessageSender] for current client
<5> `connectionId` is unique identifier of the client
<6> `CONNECT` event signals new client has been connected
<7> `MESSAGE` event signals new incoming message
<8> `DISCONNECT` event signals client has been disconnected
<9> The method must always return `WebSocketResponse.OK` to signal success

Once the function is ready you can deploy the function to AWS Lambda and setup the new API Gateway with WebSocket API

.Create new WebSocket API

.Create WebSocket API Routes

Another example is a simple AWS Lambda function to react to any of events supported by AWS Lambda and push to WebSocket clients.

NOTE: There is no support for routing at the moment, but you can get the matched route from
`event.requestContext.routeKey`.

----
<1> `MessageSender` can be injected if you specify `aws.websocket.connnections.url` configuration property
<2> You can for example react on records published into Simple Notification Service
<3> Send message to the client (in previous example the `connectionId` was set to the `subject` of the SNS record)
<4> If the client is already disconnected then `AmazonClientException` may occur

If you want to publish to the WebSockets using https://agorapulse.github.io/micronaut-libraries/docs/javadoc/micronaut-aws-sdk/com/agorapulse/micronaut/aws/apigateway/ws/MessageSender.html[MessageSender]
your Lambda function's role must have following permissions (preferably constrained just your API resource):

[source,JSON,ident=0]
.ExecuteApiFullAccess Policy
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "execute-api:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
----



==== Testing
You can very easily mock any of the interfaces. Create request event manually and follow
http://guides.micronaut.io/micronaut-function-aws-lambda/guide/index.html#functiontests[the guide to test functions with Micronaut].
